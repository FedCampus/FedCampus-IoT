# Data Collection



### Motivation

Since we have FedFT (see platform) algorithm whose correctness is verified by some experiences, devices, and student resources on our campus, we can make this theory a practical application. Therefore, we decided to develop a FedCampus platform based on FedFT algorithm and may cater to more FA algorithms in the future.

### Preview

This project implements an Android App to collect health and exercise data for FL training. It has two main function: data collection and local differential privacy (DP). Besides, this project also needs support iot for FL training, e.g: using smart watch.

#### Task

* Communication
* Data Storage
* Algorithm
* UI
* HealthKit & FL Platform

#### Communication

* Build a Apollo broker
  * Build a server to monitor message communication
  *   To verify correctness, use Mqtt.fx / MqttX / EMqtt

      <figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
*   Fix the bug of MQTT subscribe

    * Publish function is implemented well. But there's a little bug in subscribe function: messageArrived is not called when subscribing message (in MainActivity.java)
    * You can also implement TCP version and forget about all the structure of MQTT if you are good at TCP

#### Data Storage

* Local storage: LitePal (finished)
* Cloud storage: Ali Cloud (supporting MQTT), setup a dashboard by the instruction in resources (to do)

#### UI (Easy task)

* Beautify
* English version for international student
* ![](<.gitbook/assets/image (2).png>)![](<.gitbook/assets/image (4).png>)

#### Algorithm

* Implement local differential privacy algorithm

#### Health Kit

* After obtaining the authentication, plug in health kit to let the app automatically collect data
* Smart watch plug-in: collect data from the watch
