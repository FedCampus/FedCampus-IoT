<font color="lightblue">feedback Mar, 16th:
- Learn more knowledge about managing github since we will start to modify code on github this code. 
> Work have started, but current priority for me is to fully setup the server so further development can happen.
- Work on your plan. It's strongly suggested that you should communicate with jinghen before starting write code. Our goal is to implement a basic server with complete functionality within this month.
> Will work on that, initial decision made and will need to work with [@FedML](https://github.com/orgs/FedCampus/teams/fedml)
